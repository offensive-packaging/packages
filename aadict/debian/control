Description: Auto-Attribute Dict (Python 3)
 This package contains a Python dict sub-class that allows attribute-style
 access to dict items, e.g. d.foo is equivalent to d['foo']. aadict also
 provides a few other helpful methods, such as pick and omit methods. Also, an
 aadict is more call chaining friendly (e.g. methods such as update return
 self) and is pickle'able.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
