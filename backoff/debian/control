Description: Function decoration for backoff and retry (Python 3)
 This package provides function decorators which can be used to wrap a function
 such that it will be retried until some condition is met. It is meant to be of
 use when accessing unreliable resources with the potential for intermittent
 failures i.e. network resources and external APIs. Somewhat more generally, it
 may also be of use for dynamically polling resources for externally generated
 content.
 .
 Decorators support both regular functions for synchronous code and asyncio's
 coroutines for asynchronous code.
 .
 This package installs the library for Python 3.
